Description: NVIDIA Collective Communication Library (NCCL) Runtime
 NCCL (pronounced "Nickel") is a stand-alone library of standard collective
 communication routines for GPUs, implementing all-reduce, all-gather, reduce,
 broadcast, and reduce-scatter.
 It has been optimized to achieve high bandwidth on any platform using PCIe,
 NVLink, NVswitch, as well as networking using InfiniBand Verbs or TCP/IP
 sockets.
