Description: Optimized primitives for collective multi-GPU communication
 NCCL (pronounced "Nickel") is a stand-alone library of standard collective communication routines,
 such as all-gather, reduce, broadcast, etc., that have been optimized to achieve high bandwidth over PCIe.
 NCCL supports up to eight GPUs and can be used in either single- or multi-process (e.g., MPI) applications.
